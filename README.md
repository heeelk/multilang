# Multilang
The plugin helps to set up multilanguage on a multisite.
### Getting started
1. Set up a Multisite.
    - It is important to specify the correct language in the general settings of each site (`Site -> Setings -> General -> Site Language`).
2. Install and activate the plugin "Multilang".
3. Go to the plugin settings and fill in the slug fields (`Network -> Multilang`).

To get an array of languages, use the `get_languages` method.
